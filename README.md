# Wildcard Arguments
- When you don't know how many args to pass in a fn
- Generalises function up to arbitrarily many inputs
- Non-keyword args: *args
- Keyword args: **kwargs
  - e.g. greet(fname="Aamod")

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY coding principles
- Group similar codes and fns together in a separate file
- Solves the problem of code file being too lengthy and complex
- Can be reused across several programs
- Python comes with many modules: The Python Standard Library
